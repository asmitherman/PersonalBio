	<h1> My Interests</h1>
<div class="container">
	<p>Lately I have been really into computer programming and starting
		custom projects. I have been trying to build rasberry pi into a custom
		home security system. It's way overkill but its fun to mess with and when
		I get bored with that I can repurpose it for another cool project.
	</p>
	<p>Something really cool about me is that I'm a ultra runner. The sport of
		ultra running boils down to participating in long distance endurance runs
		mostly on trails that are distances further than a marathon (26.2mi).
	</p>
	<p>I have pretty diverse range of interests but I like to believe that being involved
		with computers somehow alows me to tie things together. I deeply enjoy integrating technology
		into my daily life.
