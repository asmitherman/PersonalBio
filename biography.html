			<h1> My Computing Biography</h1>
			<div class="container">
					<p>First off I would like to say that I didn't choose to take an intro to web class.
		 				Although, the topics I've learned in this basic web class has helped me in the
		 				advanced web development class which I'm taking concurently.</p>
					<p>I have absolutely no previous experience in web dev so these courses have
		 				been very intersting. In the advanced class there are so many cool project ideas
		 				that I have and want to execute. I very much prefer the backend stuff when it comes
		 				to web but designing the interface and how users interact with data on a page also
		 				gets me excited </p>
					<p>I am currently working on a web app that alows users to create listing for multiple
						websites at one form. Like eBay, Amazon, newEgg, craigslist, and many more. It has
						been a valuble experience learning how to use API and interacting with a database.</p>
